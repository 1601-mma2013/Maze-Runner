Financial constraints : 

AR requires user to download the APK file, so that the marker can be trance. For android, its free for the developer to upload the apk file for the targeted user. But the world 2nd most selling object, IPHONE, needs the user to pay for the developer ID. It will cost the Developer USD 99 (MYR 400.02) per year. Hence, this is the constrain that caused by financil.

2. Audit

Visuals are an important part of advertising, it is not a surprise that many companies start using Augmented Reality (AR) Bandwagon, offering tools that visualize their products in a magical and memorable way. However there are 3 ways of creating Augumented Reality in the market now.

- Marker-based AR
-This technique uses camera and a visual marker baked into the content that a marketer wants to present, the viewer holds up the content to the camera to see the AR in action.
There was this amazing new advertisement for mini that used marker-based augmented reality to create a truly interactive media piece out of a 2-dimensional magazine ad.
