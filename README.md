## I. Analysis

### 1. Research

### a. Scope

-------

>*This interactive artwork is to inspire the others with Yasmin Ahmad’s breakthrough. She was the very first Malaysia Figure to be honored on google search engine. Google paid tribute to her by publishing a doodle bearing her image (Our Marker). Malaysia is multi-racial country. As she said she paid attention to all the details around her to produce the work. We used colors to represents the “elements” that she used to produce her work. Where Green represents Malay, Red Represents Chinese, Orange represents Indian, Blue represents Unity.By using these elements her work was awarded internatinally to propagate Yasmin's teachings of love, acceptance and harmony in a multi-racial nation.*

2. Competitors / alternatives / replacement
-------
>* There was a digital art exhibition and film screening called ‘In her Own Words : A celebration of humanity and universal love’ as a tribute to Yasmin Ahmad’s life and legacy. Using Yasmin’s own blog as inspiration. The artist blended her own words with striking visual images to create an art series as progressive as Yasmin’s thought. The artist was so inspired by Yasmin’s outlook on life and her inspirational body of work, that he devoted his expertise to paying tribute to one of Malaysia’s visionary figures.
>* Plan B ipoh had an art installment on the life and works of Yasmin Ahmad. The commemorative Yasmin Ahmad installation, named "Small Town Big Heart" is a photographic journey from in and around ipoh town super-imposed with witty quotes and anecdotes carefully selected from the book, "Yasmin, How You Know".


### 3.Relevant technologies
-------
This project was build with Marker-based AR technique and executed with the help of webcam as the mirror. The reason why this project was built in AR because it helps to portrait the life path of Yasmin Ahmad with her spirit. If the audience pay attention to the maze(as life path) the wall was mounted with yasmin's face. This project also needed a mirror effect, where AR and the tool, webcam, fits perfectly into the project. 


### c. Stakeholder Interviews (internal / external)
In this case, we planned to have this installation in "Yasmin At Kong Heng Museum". A resource centre as well as unconventional ‘museum’ curated with the objective of educating and inspiring others to write film or commercial scripts of their own. It is a small but flexible space where the late Yasmin Ahmad’s spirit, love, wisdom and sense of humour can continue inspiring the next generation.
The location of Kong Heng in Ipoh was chosen for its proximity to many of the locales where Yasmin shot her famous films.
It will not be a conventional museum for a ‘dead person’s things’ or stagnant archives with permanent plaques. Instead, 
Yasmin At Kong Heng is an evolving space with content that is refreshed every 6 months to 1 year. Yasmin’s life’s work - whether in film, poetry, photography, TV and even print advertising – will be shared in a “newseum” that inspires and springboards 
new talent and ideas.And, in the near future, a place for local creative talent to shine – from students and aspiring filmmakers to new artists who need an exhibition space. Facebook Link : www.facebook.com/yasminatkongheng

Risk
- Vistor might be find it hard to control the maze. 
- Vistor might not have a smart phone.
- Vistor might not have internet data to download the APK file.

Obstacles
- This project is placed in darkplace, the light souce might not be enough, the other projected project might produce some unwanted light source to interfere the webcam to detect the marker.


Constraints
Internal limitations
- The Internal limitations like the marker is not allow to leave the distance of 54cm to detect the maze. 
- The program doesnt allow the it to export to exe(only into apk).

Opportunities
- Vistors might find it challenging to continue the maze
- Vistor spending more time around the museum.
- Provide a interactive experience with new media technologies.

# II. Synthesis
## 3. Requirements Definition
Describe necessary capabilities of the product

1. Functional and data needs
> When the user faced the marker towards the camera. The program will detect the marker and allow the user to interact with the project by playing the maze game. The maze is only visible in the digital screen. The user is require to rotate the marker to move the ball. while the marker is moving, the program will detect the movement and excute the correct function.

2. user mental models
> Using the curiosity of the human being. While the user is playing the maze, they are believe to zoom in and out. They should realize the wall is mounted with yasmin's face. Furthermore, The colors that the race of Malaysia favourite are quite signaficant. 

3. design imperatives
> The maze represents yasmin's life path how she achieve her achievements. Yes, the audience is the one controlling the maze, but the audience was the one choose to pay attention or not, to go to exist 1 or 2. The elements that yasmin used to produce her work was potraited in colors. The colors of the wall was based on an research contacted by Dr Forest Lim, where red is the favourite color of chinese, Green is the favourite color of Malay, Orange is the favourite color of Indian. and of course based on the national flag that yasmin came from, Malaysia, Blue represents Unity.

>- To feel that we are the director of our life, we choose our path.
>- To insipre others with "Semangat Yasmin", Yasmin's spirit.
>- User explore the playfulness of human-computer interaction.

6. technology
>- Marker-based AR
>- This technique uses camera and a visual marker baked into the content that a marketer wants to present, the viewer holds up the content to the camera to see the AR in action. There was this amazing new advertisement for mini that used marker-based augmented reality to create a truly interactive media piece out of a 2-dimensional magazine ad. 

## 4. Design Framework
### a. Elements
Deﬁne manifestations of information and functionality

1. Information
> The user is require to stand on the mark X and control the maze only within the table (54cm). The maze is only visible in the 40 inch TV that we provided in front of the user. The user has to face the marker into the webcam. The maze is a tribute to Yasmin Ahmad, during the user is playing with the maze, they can view the maze in 3D. In result that, this allow the users to see what is around the maze.

2. functions
> When the user faced the marker towards the camera. The program will detect the marker and allow the user to interact with the project by playing the maze game. The maze is only visible in the digital screen. The user is require to rotate the marker to move the ball. while the marker is moving, the program will detect the movement and excute the correct function.

3. Form Factor
> This project mainly focus on the digital form.

4. actions
> User is require to move only within the table. and rotate it.


### b. Framework
Design overall structure of user experience

1. Spatial Arrangement
David S. Hogsette points out that "technical writers may use spatial order to explain how a mechanism works; architects use spatial order to describe a building design; food critics reviewing a new restaurant use spatial order to describe and evaluate the dining area" (Writing That Makes Sense, 2008). In descriptions of places and objects, spatial order determines the perspective from which readers observe the details.

The setup for this project is above. With the help of the two table lamp, User will first see what is the light pointing at. Human will always look what is near to them. Hence, we placed the light and marker infront is to hope to bring the user into the "artwork" with the help of words. Television is push to the edge of the table so that the user feels bigger while playing the project. The webcam is placed in the middle so that the user who is using it will be the main focus.

### c. Key Path and Validation Scenarios
Describe how the persona interacts with the project.

1. Eli was attracted by the lights of a project. she walked there but there is no one there to explain what to do. 

2. Anyhow, her personal background allows her to identify the marker and face it to the webcam after knowing this is an Augmented reality installation. Eli was shock when she sees the digital screen, There is a maze ready for her to play. Eli also realize that is two exist, she decided to go with the one she preferred.

3. While Eli was rotating the marker horizontally to move the ball. She has some hardtime controlling the maze at first, because it was not mirror-ed. As she is a quick learner, she controlls the maze smoother as time pass. She realized the wall was mounted with Yasmin's image.

4. After watching the exist video showing how Yasmin's Award and nomination through out the world. Eli planned to work harder and achieve a better life quality, not only in term of money, but also mentally.
