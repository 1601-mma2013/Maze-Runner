#Maze-Runner

A.	Research 

1.	Scope
This Augmented Reality (AR) project help the user to explore the playfulness of human-computer interaction. The user is require to stand on the mark X and control the maze but the maze is only visible on the screen infront of the user.

Objectives : 
•	To help the user explore the playfulness of human-computer interaction.
•	To Superimpose computer-generated information directly into a user’s sensory perception.
•	To potrait the chinese saying “one's life is like a play, a play is like one's life “
•	To potrait the we are the director of our life.

TimeLine :

-week 09
•	Prepare for the Proposal/Analysis of the game(Maze Runner).

-week 10
•	Consultation for the Analysis.
•	Research about the technique is going to be use.
•	Prepare the “Blue Print” of the maze.

-week 11
•	Start of Building the project phase 1.
•	Consultation for the project phase 1 on the middle of the week.
•	Start making the project phase 2, Demonstration video, after consultation.

-week 12
•	Consultation for the project phase 2.
•	Finish of the project phase 1.

-week 13
•	Final Edit for the Demonstration Video.
•	Finalize phase 2 by end of the week.

-week 14
•	Final Presentation of Github page with demonstration video.

Financial constraints :
AR requires user to download the APK file, so that the marker can be trance. For android, its free for the developer to upload the apk file for the targeted user. But the world 2nd most selling object, IPHONE, needs the user to pay for the developer ID. It will cost the Developer USD 99 (MYR 400.02) per year. Hence, this is the constrain that caused by financial.

Process :
-Week 9
•	We have researched the background of AR, example of popular AR game, and also some tutorials to create it.
•	http://mashable.com/category/augmented-reality/ (What is Augmented Reality)
•	http://www.marxentlabs.com/top-5-augmented-reality-games-2014/ (Popular AR games)
•	http://computer.howstuffworks.com/augmented-reality.htm (How does AR work)
•	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjNAPCFaZ9Y (Tutorial)
•	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23_sboxOH34 (Tutorial)

-Week 10
Working on the design part and also the digital part like setting the ball’s gravity, etc. (week 11 : (Monday) the maze should be ready to be tested. 

-Week 11
-Week 12
-Week 13

-Week 14
•	Final Presentation of Github page with demonstration video.

2.	Audit

a)	Market/Field Research
AR game allow player a unique perspective, innovative gameplay option and the ability to interact with games directly rather than through a controller or a keyboard. Hence, there is some company using AR to produce game like Sony(PS VITA), Zenfri Inc(Clandestine : Anomaly), Nintendo.

Example link : https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=74&v=dvsNnm5lbR4 (Digimon for PS VITA)

Example link : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sj2iQyBTQs (Pokemon GO)

b)	Competitors / Alternatives / Replacement
There are similar Maze Games using AR. But most of the Maze game in the market needed devices like Nintando WII, and some in screen controller
  Competitors as below :

c)	relevant technologies
Visuals are an important part of advertising, it is not a surprise that many companies start using Augmented Reality (AR) Bandwagon, offering tools that visualize their products in a magical and memorable way. However there are 3 ways of creating Augumented Reality in the market now.

•	Marker-based AR 
o	This technique uses camera and a visual marker baked into the content that a marketer wants to present, the viewer holds up the content to the camera to see the AR in action. There was this amazing new advertisement for mini that used marker-based augmented reality to create a truly interactive media piece out of a 2-dimensional magazine ad.
Example Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTYeuo6pIjY

•	Markerless AR
o	This technique uses a graphic instead of marker. In result, AR implementation and use is easier: marketers can use existing graphics to present their AR ads and consumers can vew them easily. 
Example Link : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sj2iQyBTQs

•	Layar, Goggles
o	Smartphone AR app like goggles, free for Android phones, and Layar, free for Anroid and Apple devices, allow users to point their smartphones in any direction, look throught the camera viewers, and reveal information about what they see.

2.	Stakeholder Interview 
a.	Risk
•	The risk of using marker Augmented reality is the marker might not be able to be detected. The game might keep restarting while the marker signal lost.

b.	Obstacles
•	This project is placed in darkplace, the light souce might not be enough, the other projected project might produce some unwanted light source to interfere the webcam to detect the marker.

c.	Constraints 
•	Internal Limitation
The are some constraints that we face for this project. The lack of technical background is one of the main constraints that we had. Furthermore, as us, student money is the main problem for producing this project. The cost of renting equipments like computer, webcam, table-light, and some printings for the marker.

d.	Opportunities 
•	In spite of obstacles we have in building this project , we got support not only in the term of money but also technical. Below is the souce of our strength :
o	Center For Interactive Media, providing us techical skill “lecturing”.
o	Faculty of Creative Multimedia, MMU, renting equipments to us for free. 
o	Media Art Design 3 class, providing exhibition space for Us to display our project. 

3.	User Observations

a.	Users 
o	Most of our user are art students from Faculty of Creative Multimedia. The users are from the range of 18-24 years old.

b.	Potiential Users
o	Students that are into the technologies. Some might be art student, some might be Information technology student, or maybe engeering student. The potiential Users should start from the range of 18 years old to 24 years old.
