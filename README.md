## I. Analysis

### 1. Research

### a. Scope

-------

>*This interactive artwork is to inspire the others with Yasmin Ahmad’s breakthrough. She was the very first Malaysia Figure to be honored on google search engine. Google paid tribute to her by publishing a doodle bearing her image (Our Marker). Malaysia is multi-racial country. As she said she paid attention to all the details around her to produce the work. We used colors to represents the “elements” that she used to produce her work. Where Green represents Malay, Red Represents Chinese, Orange represents Indian, Blue represents Unity.By using these elements her work was awarded internatinally to propagate Yasmin's teachings of love, acceptance and harmony in a multi-racial nation.*

2. Competitors / alternatives / replacement
-------
>* There was a digital art exhibition and film screening called ‘In her Own Words : A celebration of humanity and universal love’ as a tribute to Yasmin Ahmad’s life and legacy. Using Yasmin’s own blog as inspiration. The artist blended her own words with striking visual images to create an art series as progressive as Yasmin’s thought. The artist was so inspired by Yasmin’s outlook on life and her inspirational body of work, that he devoted his expertise to paying tribute to one of Malaysia’s visionary figures.
>* Plan B ipoh had an art installment on the life and works of Yasmin Ahmad. The commemorative Yasmin Ahmad installation, named "Small Town Big Heart" is a photographic journey from in and around ipoh town super-imposed with witty quotes and anecdotes carefully selected from the book, "Yasmin, How You Know".


### 3.Relevant technologies
-------
This project was build with Marker-based AR technique and executed with the help of webcam as the mirror. The reason why this project was built in AR because it helps to portrait the life path of Yasmin Ahmad with her spirit. If the audience pay attention to the maze(as life path) the wall was mounted with yasmin's face. This project also needed a mirror effect, where AR and the tool, webcam, fits perfectly into the project. The maze represents yasmin's life path how she achieve her achievements. Yes, the audience is the one controlling the maze, but the audience was the one choose to pay attention or not, to go to exist 1 or 2. 

>* Marker-based AR 
>-This technique uses camera and a visual marker baked into the content that a marketer wants to present, the viewer holds up the content to the camera to see the AR in action. There was this amazing new advertisement for mini that used marker-based augmented reality to create a truly interactive media piece out of a 2-dimensional magazine ad. 



### c. Stakeholder Interviews (internal / external)
In this case, we planned to have this installation in "Yasmin At Kong Heng Museum". A resource centre as well as unconventional ‘museum’ curated with the objective of educating and inspiring others to write film or commercial scripts of their own. It is a small but flexible space where the late Yasmin Ahmad’s spirit, love, wisdom and sense of humour can continue inspiring the next generation.
The location of Kong Heng in Ipoh was chosen for its proximity to many of the locales where Yasmin shot her famous films.
It will not be a conventional museum for a ‘dead person’s things’ or stagnant archives with permanent plaques. Instead, 
Yasmin At Kong Heng is an evolving space with content that is refreshed every 6 months to 1 year. Yasmin’s life’s work - whether in film, poetry, photography, TV and even print advertising – will be shared in a “newseum” that inspires and springboards 
new talent and ideas.And, in the near future, a place for local creative talent to shine – from students and aspiring filmmakers to new artists who need an exhibition space. Facebook Link : www.facebook.com/yasminatkongheng

Obstacles
- This project is placed in darkplace, the light souce might not be enough, the other projected project might produce some unwanted light source to interfere the webcam to detect the marker.


Constraints
Internal limitations
- The Internal limitations like the marker is not allow to leave the distance of 54cm to detect the maze. 
- The program doesnt allow the it to export to exe(only into apk).

Opportunities
- Vistors might find it challenging to continue the maze
- Vistor spending more time around the museum.
- Provide a interactive experience with new media technologies.
