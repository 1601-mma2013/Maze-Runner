## I. Analysis

### 1. Research

### a. Scope

-------

>*This interactive artwork is to inspire the others with Yasmin Ahmad’s breakthrough. She was the very first Malaysia Figure to be honored on google search engine. Google paid tribute to her by publishing a doodle bearing her image (Our Marker). Malaysia is multi-racial country. As she said she paid attention to all the details around her to produce the work. We used colors to represents the “elements” that she used to produce her work. Where Green represents Malay, Red Represents Chinese, Orange represents Indian, Blue represents Unity.By using these elements her work was awarded internatinally to propagate Yasmin's teachings of love, acceptance and harmony in a multi-racial nation.*

2. Competitors / alternatives / replacement
-------
>* There was a digital art exhibition and film screening called ‘In her Own Words : A celebration of humanity and universal love’ as a tribute to Yasmin Ahmad’s life and legacy. Using Yasmin’s own blog as inspiration. The artist blended her own words with striking visual images to create an art series as progressive as Yasmin’s thought.

The commemorative Yasmin Ahmad installation, named "Small Town Big Heart" is a photographic journey from in and around ipoh town super-imposed with witty quotes and anecdotes carefully selected from the book, "Yasmin, How You Know".


### 3.Relevant technologies
- Visuals are an important part of advertising, it is not a surprise that many companies start using Augmented Reality (AR) Bandwagon, offering tools that visualize their products in a magical and memorable way. However there are 3 ways of creating Augumented Reality in the market now. 
>* Marker-based AR 
>-This technique uses camera and a visual marker baked into the content that a marketer wants to present, the viewer holds up the content to the camera to see the AR in action. There was this amazing new advertisement for mini that used marker-based augmented reality to create a truly interactive media piece out of a 2-dimensional magazine ad. 
>* Markerless AR *
>- This technique uses a graphic instead of marker. In result, AR implementation and use is easier: marketers can use existing graphics to present their AR ads and consumers can vew them easily.

>* Layar, Goggles *
>- Smartphone AR app like goggles, free for Android phones, and Layar, free for Anroid and Apple devices, allow users to point their smartphones in any direction, look throught the camera viewers, and reveal information about what they see.

### c. Stakeholder Interviews (internal / external)

Product Vision
•	 User explore the playfulness of human-computer interaction.
•	 To feel that we are the director of our life, we choose our path.
•	User explore the playfulness of human-computer interaction.
•	To feel that we are the director of our life, we choose our path.

Risk
- The risk of using marker Augmented reality is the marker might not be able to be detected. The game might keep restarting while the marker signal lost.

Obstacles
- This project is placed in darkplace, the light souce might not be enough, the other projected project might produce some unwanted light source to interfere the webcam to detect the marker.


Constraints
Internal limitations
-There are some constraints that we face for this project. The lack of technical background is one of the main constraints that we had. Furthermore, as us, student money is the main problem for producing this project. The cost of renting equipments like computer, webcam, table-light, and some printings for the marker.

Opportunities
- In spite of obstacles we have in building this project , we got support not only in the term of money but also technical. Below is the souce of our strength : 
- Center For Interactive Media, providing us techical skill “lecturing”. 
- Faculty of Creative Multimedia, MMU, renting equipments to us for free. 
- Media Art Design 3 class, providing exhibition space for Us to display our project.
